In this series, we documented everything to create an advance near industrial grade Autonomous Mobile Robot or AMR which uses State-of-the-art mathematical theories into practices along with some AI fundamentals as well.
### Prerequisites
#### [Robot Operating System (ROS2)](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/)
**The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.** From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.
#### [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/)
Gazebo Sim is an open source robotics simulator. Through Gazebo Sim, users have access to high fidelity physics, rendering, and sensor models. Additionally, users and developers have multiple points of entry to simulation including a graphical user interface, plugins, and asynchronous message passing and services.

#### [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org/jazzy/index.html)
The ros2_control is a framework for (real-time) control of robots using ROS 2. Its packages are a rewrite of [ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control) packages used in `ROS`. ros2_control’s goal is to simplify integrating new hardware and overcome some drawbacks.

#### [Nav2](https://docs.nav2.org/)
Nav2 is the professionally-supported successor of the ROS Navigation Stack deploying the same kinds of technology powering Autonomous Vehicles brought down, optimized, and reworked for mobile and surface robotics.
